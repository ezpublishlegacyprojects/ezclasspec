1. Check out the application on a web server, either remote or local. We recommend using the
   application on a locally hosted web server to speed up load times. Also, the application only
   has one storage unit, so if you install it on a web server, make sure that only one user
   accesses the application at a time.
   
2. Go to the URL of the folder where you placed the application.
